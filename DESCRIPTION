Description: Provides an interactive Shiny-based graphical user interface
    for the 'pliman' package, enabling user-friendly access to advanced
    plant image analysis tools without requiring extensive programming
    expertise. The application integrates a wide range of functionalities
    for high-throughput phenotyping, including orthomosaic analysis from
    drone and satellite imagery, shapefile creation and management, time
    series exploration, image processing, and phytopathometry. All features
    are combined into a cohesive and intuitive interface that is freely
    available for academic and research purposes, with use restricted to
    non-commercial applications.
